# Introduction
Hi! I'm Nerissa, a student in the Framework-Based Software Design and Development course. 
As an aspiring software engineer, I am keen to start learning about some industrial practices in software maintenance and evolution to enhance my current knowledge in this field. I hope to improve my code management and apply the learning points from this course in my future and ongoing projects to yield the most optimal and efficient results.
